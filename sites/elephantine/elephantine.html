      <h1>Elephantine</h1>
      <h3> Predynastic Period - 2nd Dynastic Period </h3>
	  <h4>Mercedes Reyna</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>On the Nile river lies a elephant tusk shaped island known as Elephantine. Elephantine is the greek word for elephant.
       The ancient Egyptians knew Elephantine however by the name Yebo, which also means elephant or ivory.
       Ivory was one of the main materials traded.
        Since it is further up on the Nile than the surrounding islands in Aswan, it is located in upper Egypt.
        Elephantine sits on the southern border of upper Egypt and Nubia.
        It once was a city the thrived by river trade and served as a highly defensive fortess. With the expansive trade network,
        Elephantine was home to many different ethic backgrounds.

     <h3>Geography</h3>
 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
 <p>Elephantine is located downstream of the first cateract and across from modern day Aswan.
    Currently there is a dam through the cateract.
    The island is 1,200 meters tall and 400 meters wide. It is located 24°05′ N, 32°53′ E.
    Elephantine is also referred to as the door to the south
  because its on the southern border of Egypt. In addition, Egyptians brought elephants from the south to Nubia.  </p>

 <h3>Description of the site</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>With the increasing population in Egypt many sites have been destroy to accommodate for this drastic growth.
  The only ancient traces that are left on this island are a mound circa that are 350 m wide and 15 m high.
  The east side of the isle preserves the remains of the sanctuary called “Lady of the Town”.
  Lady of the town refers to the antelope goddess Satet who was part of the tirade that the ancient Egyptians worshipped.
  Satet was an archer warrior goddess hence her name sat meaning “to shoot”. </p>

<h3>Excavations</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>The first excavations of the island took place this century; however archaeologists were more interested in discovering
   evidence of papyri rather than the site itself. In 1969, archaeologists uncovered Elephantine’s history from 4,000 years ago.
  The earliest evidence of settlement dates back to the fourth millennium B.C. </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Although archaeologists are making progress by further excavating Elephantine island,
  the complete lives of the ancient Egyptians still remain a mystery.  </p>
