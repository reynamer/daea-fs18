      <h1>Elephantine</h1>
      <h3> Predynastic Period - 2nd Dynastic Period </h3>

         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>On the Nile river lies an elephant tusk shaped island known as Elephantine.
       Elephantine is the Greek word for elephant. The ancient Egyptians knew Elephantine however by the name Yebo,
        which also means elephant or ivory. Ivory was one of the main materials traded.
        Since it is further up on the Nile than the surrounding islands in Aswan, it is in upper Egypt.
         Elephantine sits on the southern border of upper Egypt and Nubia. It once was a city the thrived by river trade
          and served as a highly defensive fortress. With the expansive trade network, Elephantine was home to many different
           ethnic backgrounds. Egyptians, Nubians, Greeks, Romans, and some Hebrews all lived
            in Elephantine at one point in ancient times. Most of early ancient Egyptians worshipped the triad
             that consisted of Khnum, Satet, and Anket. With diversity, however, new religions were practiced such as Christianity.
             Elephantine holds many artifacts that are now housed at the Aswan museum.
             Further excavations are taking place to uncover Elephantine's past. </p>

     <h3>Geography</h3>
 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
 <p>Elephantine is located downstream of the first cataract and across from modern day Aswan.
    Currently there is a dam through the cataract. Of the six cataracts, the first cataract is
    the only cataract in Egypt, the rest are in Sudan.
    The island is 1,200 meters tall and 400 meters across the widest point. It is known to be one of the largest islands on the Nile river.
    It is located 24°05′ N, 32°53′ E.
    Elephantine is also referred to as the door to the south
  because it’s on the southern border of Egypt. In addition, Egyptians brought elephants from the south to Nubia.
   Near the island there are several large boulders that could appear as elephants in the water,
   which is another reason perhaps the island is named after an elephant.

   On the island, several millstones made of red granite were found by archaeologists.
    The temple of Khnum was built with pink granite.
   Granite is found throughout Elephantine.

 <h3>Description of the site</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>With the increasing population in Egypt many sites have been destroy to accommodate for this drastic growth.
  Temples have also been destroyed due to tourism.
  The only ancient traces that are left on this island are a mound circa that are 350 m wide and 15 m high.
  The east side of the isle preserves the remains of the sanctuary called “Lady of the Town”.
  Lady of the town refers to the antelope goddess Satet who was part of the tirade that the ancient Egyptians worshipped.
  Satet was an archer warrior goddess hence her name sat meaning “to shoot”. Satet was also know as a fertility goddess. The temple of Satet was around during 3200 B.C.
 Archaeologists found evidence that the temple was repeatively reconstructed.   </p>

<h3>Excavations</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>The first excavations of the island took place this century; however archaeologists were more interested in discovering
   evidence of papyri rather than the site itself. In 1969, archaeologists uncovered Elephantine’s history from 4,000 years ago.
  The earliest evidence of settlement dates back to the fourth millennium B.C. Elephantine is one of the few sites in Egypt that holds
   artifacts dating back to the pre-dynastic period. </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Although archaeologists are making progress by further excavating Elephantine island,
  the complete lives of the ancient Egyptians still remain a mystery.  </p>
