      <p>The Sac Uitzil Ba Rockshelter is located south of the Belizean capital of Belompan in the Caves Branch River Valley.  Located near other rockshelters within the limestone cliffs that within the river valley, but far from any major ancient Maya political entity, this rockshelter was most likely used by the rural agrarian communities that utilized the river system for their crops.  Modern agriculture has greatly disturbed or destroyed many small and ancient farming communities, so rockshelters such as Sac Uitzil Ba act as important conduits to understanding agrarian life for the prehistoric Maya.</p>

      <p>Subterannean spaces were areas of great cultural importance within the ancient Maya cosmology, and still play roles in modern day rituals among Maya indigenous communities.  Though not technically subterannean in the same sense as a cave, rockshelters were still the locations of rituals, both funerary and non-funerary.  The presence of primary burials within the matrix of the Sac Uitzil Ba Rockshelter indicates that this space had some sort of mortuary component.  Based on the presence of mostly primary burials (modern looting has somewhat obscured this), it is likely that SUB functioned primarily as a genetically kin-based ossuary in a ritually and culturally charged space, intended to lay some sort of claim to the physical world while simultaneously utilizing the subterannean aspect of the landscape as a threshhold to the underworld.</p>

     <h3>Discovery</h3>

Sac Uitzil Ba Rockshelter is located in the northeast corner of the research area, denoted by the red lettering."</figcaption>
     </figure>

     <p>The site of Sac Uitzil Ba was formally discovered by Central Belize Archaeological Survey (CBAS) senior staff member Jack A. Biggs during the summer of 2017.  Sac Uitzil Ba (meaning the white mountain gopher in the Mopan Mayan language) was found mostly by accident.  Excavations of the 2017 field season were originally set to take place at the nearby Sapodilla Rockshelter (see map).  While hiking back after excavating one day during the early field season, site co-directors Jack A. Biggs and Amy Michaeld took the Michigan State University field crew to go exploring in some known nearby caves.  While walking around the base of a limestone cliff near the caves, Biggs came across another small but deep rockshelter.  The rockshelter had undergone some looting activity as evidenced by fragmented human skeletal remains and potsherds scattered across the rockshelter floor. </p>

     <p>Brief documentation was conducted that first.  Excavations at Sapodilla Rockshelter had yielded little material as it had been extensively looted since the 2011 excavations that took place at the site.  Excavation units at Sapodilla were completed with the remainder of the field season focused on the newly discovered rockkshelter.</p>

     <p>During the first official day of excavations at Sac Uitzil Ba, a second and connecting chamber within the rockshelter was discovered.  Accessible from the first chamber of SUB via a small tunnel or over a large stone ledge high up the rockface, the second chamber is located higher above the ground surface than the main lower chamber.  Two other entrances were discvered to reach up to the second chamber from the jungle floor by hiking up a steep incline.  Due to the small nature of both these chambers, excavation operations were split in between the two chambers.  The first and lower chamber discovered was then termed the Main Chamber while the newer and higher chamber was named the Upper Chamber.</p>

     <p>The Upper Chamber connected only to the Main Chamber and to the outside jungle.  Small tunnels and niches inaccessible for humans exist and have not been explored.  However, the rear of the Main Chamber connects to a small and winding cave system.  Large rims from ancient Maya water jars were discovered in a far back chamber and down a wash and were calcified in place.  Other tunnels tunnels connect to ledges above the rockshelter's Main Chamber, though no cultural materials were found there.  Additionally, no other ecidence has been found of cultural materials within the caves themselves.  The floor of the caves is either flowstone or clay that most likely existed in antiquity and was not modified.</p>
