     <h3>Regional and Geographic Setting</h3>
 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Tell Edfu is located in Upper Egypt on the western banks of the Nile River, halfway between Aswan and Luxor. The entire site spans about six hectares with the tell a few meters west of the Ptolemaic Temple and five kilometers to the north of a small step pyramid, north of the village el-Ghonameya (1). The tell itself is a mound formed from the continuous buildup of settlements over centuries of civilization. This mound may have originally been a sandstone island formation with a cliff on its eastern edge, confining the entire occupation of the site to the tell, due to the Nile floods that affected the lower-lying areas (2).  By the time the tell was abandoned in the tenth century AD, the mound rose to about twenty to twenty-five meters above the Ptolemaic Temple (3). In present day, due to sebakh digging, the tell to the west of the temple is ten to fifteen meters high and extends 365 meters north to south and 168 meters east and west (3). The archaeological site over time, has been encroached upon by modern buildings and some ancient remains to the east of the temple are located underneath such buildings and cannot be excavated. The geological composition of the site consists primarily of a natural sandstone bedrock formation with several layers of sand and clay (4). The area also included sebakh, rich soil, that was dug out and used by the local peoples, millennia later, as a fertilizer for agriculture (4). This type of digging has affected archaeological finds and destroys the stratigraphy of the site. </p>

 <h3>Site Description</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>The site of Tell Edfu is mostly characterized by the old Ptolemaic temple built during the reign of Ptolemy III on its eastern side (4). The tell itself occupies a large amount of space to the west of the temple and the remains of the eastern tell are buried under the architecture of modern buildings and homes in modern Edfu. Although the temple, dedicated to Horus, is a more attractive and beautifully designed piece of architecture, this mound of sand and soil can give an archaeologist a lot more information about the inner workings of Ancient Egypt.</p> <p>In the northern area of the tell lie traces of enclosure walls from the First Intermediate Period. These walls mark the northern limits of the site and show traces of settlements from the early Middle Kingdom. This area is labeled by Nadine Moeller and her team at the University of Chicago as “Zone 3” (4).</p><p>On the eastern part of the tell, directly beside the Ptolemaic Temple is “Zone 2” which consists of Old Kingdom settlement remains as well as more enclosure walls (5). Next to the Mammisi built during the reign of Ptolemy VIII and Euergetus II is “Zone 1” which consists of a silo courtyard built atop an abandoned columned hall (4). This courtyard contains eighteen silos that belonged to a large granary court which acted as the primary grain reserve of the ancient town during the Second Intermediate Period (3). Before the silos were constructed, a large columned hall, containing sixteen columns, housed the administrative complex of Edfu during the Middle Kingdom (3). When this hall fell out of use, the columns were torn down but some of the bases can still be seen under the excavated silo court.</p><p>Five kilometers to the south of the Tell Edfu site lies a small step pyramid. This pyramid is located near a modern cemetery as well as an access road that leads to a highway linking Cairo and Aswan (1). This has endangered the site and preservation of the pyramid has been furthered by members of the Tell Edfu Project.</p>

<h3>Discussion of Excavations</h3>
<p>From 1860 to 1861, Auguste Mariette cleared the temple and its entrance from sand (5). Fourty+ years later in 1903 and 1905, Alexandre Barsanti went to fix a nearly collapsing wall of the Ptolemaic Temple. By doing this, he cleared an area of the western tell, thus destroying archaeological remains (5). Henri Henne was the first to publish a report on his excavations of the site from 1921-1922 (3). Henne excavated the tombs of an early Islamic cemetery as well as the uppermost strata of the tell which contained mostly Coptic and Roman remains (3). Six years later, in 1928, Octave Guéraud excavated this same area and Maurice Alliot, who took over three years later, excavated the middle area of the tell along with mastaba tombs dating to the Old Kingdom (3). From 1914 to 1937, Tell Edfu was a French concession and from 1937 to 1939 it was overseen by Bernard Bruyère and Kazimierz Michalowski, thus becoming a Franco-Polish concession (3). Under this concession, Byzantine, Roman, and Ptolemaic layers were excavated as well as the cemetery from the Old and Middle Kingdom (3). In 1975 the site was visited by Manfred Bietak and by Barry Kemp in 1976. They both looked at the importance of the pharaonic settlement at Edfu and emphasized its potential as an early Egyptian town (3).</p><p>Starting in 2001, the Tell Edfu project led by Nadine Moeller has focused on the development of Tell Edfu over time. The first several seasons consisted of a detailed survey of the site and the actual excavation work did not begin until the 2005 season. Up until the present day, the Tell Edfu project has discovered and focused on: a large columned hall, a silo court, remains of Old Kingdom settlements, a series of enclosure walls, and a small step pyramid located five kilometers south of the tell.</p><p> The large columned hall dates to the late Middle Kingdom (Twelfth and Thirteenth Dynasty) and belongs to an administrative complex. The hall itself consists of sixteen columns with six sandstone column bases found in place (3). The columns themselves have long since disappeared but the bases give an estimate for the general context and layout of this hall. The architecture of the hall, consisting of wood columns with an octagonal shape, parallels other administrative buildings from that time period, thus giving basis to the administrative nature of the complex. Two hundred seal impressions have also been found along with a hieratic ostraca fragment, suggesting the presence of scribes and other individuals performing administrative activities (3). In this area, the project also discovered a cartouche of Amenemhat III wearing the crown of Upper and Lower Egypt (6). Eleven seal impressions were also discovered, showing the cartouche of the Hyksos ruler Khyan (7).</p><p>The granary court dates to the Second Intermediate Period (Seventeenth Dynasty) and consists of eighteen circular and oval-shaped silos. This court was built over the remains of the columned hall when it became defunct after the Middle Kingdom. These silos are thought to have had dome-shaped roofs and were closed structures that stored the grain reserves of the ancient town. The dome-shaped roofs are no longer standing but the mudbrick that built the roofs can be found inside the silo, thus suggesting its past collapse (3). Once the silos fell out of use, the empty holes were used for trash: broken pieces of pottery, hippopotamus bones, ostraca, clay figurines, etc. (3).</p><p>The remains from the Old Kingdom settlement can be found in Zone 2, located directly west of the Ptolemaic Temple. This area gives evidence to the existence of houses complete with their own silos for domestic grain storage. A large building in this area has been discovered along with pottery such as beer jars and bread molds as well as traces of secondary metallurgy from the process of smelting copper (5). A courtyard and corridor from this area show the presence of fireplaces and workshops. The presence of Red Sea shells, Nubian pottery sherds, and the bread molds and beer jars all signify the administrative practices in Edfu.</p><p>Offsite is a small step pyramid that belongs to a string of similar pyramids constructed in Elephantine, Hierakonpolis, Naqada, Abydos, Zawiet el-Meitin, and Seila (7). These pyramids were built during the rule of Huni and serve as possible markers of royal power or as a marker of the royal ka cult (7).</p>

<h3>Excavation Results</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Over the course of the Tell Edfu Project, many findings have given crucial insights into the function of Tell Edfu from the Old Kingdom to the Ptolemaic period. The abandoned columned hall, along with the ostraca and the seal impressions found within, suggest that administrative activities like commodity sealing occurred here (10). The cartouche of Amenemhat III wearing the crown of Upper and Lower Egypt furthers this administrative presence and also shows the unification of the Egyptian state at that time. Another cartouche was found of the Hyksos ruler Khyan, showing contact between the Hyksos and Upper Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period (7). Both of these artifacts show the importance of communication in Ancient Egypt for both administrative and economic reasons.</p><p>According to Nadine Moeller, the large silo/granary court shows the ability of provincial towns like Edfu to recover grain from the surrounding lands and store them for long periods of time in large amounts (3). Since this court was built and used during the seventeenth dynasty (part of the Second Intermediate Period) this suggests the town’s effectiveness during a time of political instability and disintegration of the Egyptian government (3). In one of the silos, the excavation team found three human skeletons and two dogs. The significance of this find is not known yet but it has been noted that the individuals have been improperly buried (8).</p><p>Fragments of copper ore in the Old Kingdom settlement areas link Tell Edfu to mining activities as well as royal expeditions (5). Red Sea shells and Nubian pottery fragments link Edfu to these regions and suggest the presence of a well-established trade network. Edfu was located next to the main access route to the Eastern desert which enabled goods to come in from around Egypt (5). The presence of a multitude of bread molds and beer jars indicates a possible beer or bread making facility located in the town furthering the notion that the site was indeed a productive and successful ancient town (9).</p><p> The massive size and multiplicity of the silos along with the columned hall show how storage and administration are linked to a successful Egyptian economy (10). From this, one can deduce that Tell Edfu was an important and crucial location in Ancient Egypt, even during the Intermediate Periods.</p>
