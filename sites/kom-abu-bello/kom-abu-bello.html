         <h3>Introduction</h3>

		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->


		 <p>Kom Abu Bello is an ancient Egyptian site, also known as Mefket in ancient Egyptian Pharaonic times. Although there a very little remains including artifacts and tombs, and that a major part of this ancient city is now covered by the modern town of Tarana, Kom Abu Bello has played a significant role in the reconstruction of historical culture, religion, and social relations in ancient Egypt from circa 300 BC to AD 500. Especially during the period of conversion from the Pharaonic era into the Coptic era, where this site was also known as Terenuthis during the Graeco-Roman period, and later known as Terenouti during the Coptic era. </p>

     <h3>Region and Geography</h3>
    <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

    <p>Kom Abu Bello is a famous prehistoric site of Ancient Egypt. It is a small village located on the western edge of the Delta, marked in the modern town of Tarrana, north-west of the modern Egypt capital city, Cairo. The site runs along the Rosetta branch of the Nile river. This site remains on a what is considered a forgotten route that is very crucial to unveiling Egyptian history. The location of Kom Abu Bello is extremely important because it is a link between two very vast production of rich and highly valued minerals in the daily life of ancient Egyptians during the prehistoric Roman period. </p>

    <h3>Description of Site</h3>
  <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

  <p>The remains of the ancient archaeological site of Kom Abu Bello is remotely vague. Francis Llewellyn Griffith, an eminent British Egyptologist during the late 19th and early 20th century, first discovered an important fragment of this site. The temple of Hathor, also known as the “Mistress of Mefket” during the 1880s was unveiled. The site was incomplete. Evidence that still lies within the modern town of the ancient civilization is comprised of the pharaonic cemetery, mudbrick walls and tombs, ceramic lamps and artifacts, and potsherds on the surface of the land especially in the area west of Tarana called Baltous. Only a small segment of the settlement of Terenuthis had been excavated.</p>

  <p>The remains and debris of settlement were discovered on the east side of the Canal of Nasser as well as the excavated and Middle Kingdom cemeteries from the southwest and the east. There are certain limestone fragments that were found buried beneath the surface located on the northern edge of the site which were found to be the only remains of the Apollo temple due to the temple being completely demolished. A major part of the ancient city is now covered by what is now the modern town of Tarana and the cultivation that lies west and south.</p>

    <h3>Excavations and Results</h3>
  <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

  <p>The ancient archaeological site of Kom Abu Bello is alluded to the site were the Greco-Roman cemetery is found, which most likely had derived from the Greek Apollo who had a temple dedicated at the northern edge of the site. The first excavation of this site was discovered by F.L. Griffith in 1887 to 1888. Griffith had discovered and recorded the remains of the temple known as Per-Huthor-Nbt-Mefket, or the temple of Hathor, 'Mistress of Mefket'. Since the excavation by F.L. Hathor, a segment of the site was later excavated by the University of Michigan led by E. Peterson, from 1969 to 1974 as a result from the construction of the Nasser Canal that had required the salvation of what had remained. Evidence of the remains dates back to the Middle Kingdom and the restoration of the temple led into the New Kingdom era. The temple of Hathor was dedicated to honor and worship one of Egypt’s loved goddess. The Mistress of Mefket had been graphically depicted in the tomb as a symbol of a sistrum, also known as a musical instrument that was believed to have driven away evil spirits. The ruins of the temple had contained blocks of finely carved bas relief scenes depicting that it may have been built by Ptolemy I, the first Egyptian ruler during the Egyptian period and may have been finalized by Ptolemy II. A cattle cemetery was also discovered in the same area which had a connection to the worshipping of the goddess Hathor. This temple is one of the few existing and preserved tomb that has been dated back to the founder of the Greek Dynasty. </p>

  <p>Along with this monumental temple, a substantial amount of other discoveries and artifacts were made during the construct of the Nassar canal between 1969 and 1974. Some artifacts include statues of Anubis, Isis, Taweret and Best included with hieroglyphic inscriptions, stone blocks engraved with the name of Ramses the II, and pottery lamps with illustration on it. There were numerous amounts of artifacts and jewelry that were included such as gold and silver earrings, bracelets, rings, amulets, pots and amphorae.</p>

  <p>A monumental cemetery was discovered in which it preserved numerous amounts of tombstones. The tombstones dated back to the Old Kingdom during the 6th Dynasty of 2345 BC. Some of the Philistine tombs that had been discovered were found with decorations and inscriptions and texts. One of the Philistine tombs that had remained had a stelae, which is a stone or a wooden slab that was constructed during the ancient Egyptian times, usually bearing inscriptions, reliefs, or paintings of some sort as a commemorative monument. The stelae were depicted as Atilon and his family dating back to the 3rd century AD. Atilon is lying on a couch, protected by the ancient Egyptian god Anubis, who is known to watch over the dead. There were also discoveries of certain truncated pyramid shaped graves dating back to the 4th century AD.</p>
